The Prometheus vhost file in vhost.d is pre-set to use basic_auth. 
Re-use the same setup for other public facing hosts you wish to secure.

Run this command to generate a set of username+password for authentication with Nginx
htpasswd -bn <username> <password> > .htpasswd

You can also use the registry container to create the password, if you've pulled it:
docker run --rm --entrypoint htpasswd registry:2 -bn  <username> <password>> .htpasswd
